# UI components for React + Elasticsearch

> A search interface that simply works. The easiest way to build data-driven search experiences.

## Live demo

<Demo />

## Quick intro

Write expressive code to create search applications using declarative components.

```jsx
const MySearchComponent = () => (
  <Elasticsearch url="http://example.org/search">
    <SearchBox id="mainSearch" />
    <Facet id="actors" fields={["actors"]} />
    <Facet id="releasedYear" fields={["releasedYear"]} />
    <Results
      id="results"
      items={data =>
        // Map on result hits and display whatever you want.
        data.map(item => <MyCardItem key={item._id} source={item._source} />)
      }
    />
  </Elasticsearch>
);
```

## Main features

- 🏝 Released under **MIT licence**.
- 👩‍🎨 Each component is built with React and is **customisable**. Not too much extra features nor magic.
- 💅 It comes with **no style** so it's the developers responsibility to implement their own.
- 🐿 Only **35.32KB gzipped** for the whole lib, compatible with old browsers: >0.03% usage.
- 🔮 No legacy: **created in 2019**, with hooks.
